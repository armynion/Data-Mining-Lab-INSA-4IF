    "## Project detail\n",
    "The project has been carried out in pairs, during 3 practical sessions lasting 4h each. We have implemented code using Python, which is commonly used for most data mining tasks thanks to many packages: `scikit-learn` (sklearn) providing many learning algorithms and clustering algorithms, as well as `Natural Language Toolkit` (nltk) to tackle text processing tasks. This document is an experimentation report stating our main results, as well as discussions about our different choices."
